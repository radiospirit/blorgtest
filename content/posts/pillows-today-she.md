An early fave and an early release from [The Pillows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pillows). The shimmering guitar line ascends and glides above grittier, more distorted rhythm riffs, while the accompanying mv has a faintly golden sepia-tinged wash over everything, as if to evoke a lazy summer afternoon. The visual motif of the ram (car, slippers) adds a whimsical touch, as does the table set for tea down by the beach.

This song reminds me of college, and a miraculous-feeling set of events that led to me finally seeing The Pillows, live in concert, without even the reassurance of a friend to accompany me so I wouldn't be traveling to the city and back on my own. Luckily, my college's LJ community came through! Multiple other Pillows fans came to my rescue - I was determined to go, and happy for the company. Even managed to get sushi for dinner with one of my impromptu concert buddies before the show began. :3 A terrific night. And I still have the tour shirt I bought for a souvenir. :D
