*Maybe happy, maybe happy /
I dare say I'm happy*

[L'arc-en-Ciel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Arc-en-Ciel) is one of the ultimate throwback bands for me - I think I was first introduced to their music via some anime soundtrack when I was a teen, so listening to their songs again not only evokes the musical stylings they've developed since the early 90s, but also evokes the feeling of being young and energetic and brimming with anticipation and apprehension for the future.

For this song in particular, I remember watching the mv as part of a mini music video nostalgia marathon with one of my college classmates from Mandarin class. It was awesome. In her own words, the video was *dope*.

STAY AWAY contains a propulsive catchiness and positive energy that belies the video's visual references to conformist, zombie-esque office life. The angular surreal synchronized dance at the end, though bizarre, was a hilariously unexpected cap to the vid.
