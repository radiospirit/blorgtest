(from their album, *ivy*)

[noodles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noodles_(band) opened for The Pillows during the U.S. tour of the latter that I was able to catch back in college. I loved the (still) novelty of an all-girl rock band, but primarily I loved the grunge-esque alt-rock distorted power pop propulsion. They've managed to hit all the sonic notes that recall autumn and long-sleeved shirts and crisp changing leaves underfoot. I still have no idea what the recurring blurry doll motif is, other than a visual callback to their album cover, but it adds an interesting interstitial to an otherwise straightforward performance-based lo-fi video.
