I first heard [Spitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spitz_(band))'s music via the anime [Honey and Clover (*Hachimitsu to Kurōbā*)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honey_and_Clover) back in college. This particular song of theirs wasn't featured in the show, but is indicative of the kind of upbeat, sunny, jangly rock typical of their discography. From the opening guitar line to the wistful lyrics, "Robinson" conveys a summery kind of mood. There's nuance in the juxtaposition between the upbeat pace of the song and the gentle melancholy of the melody. The tune is deceptively optimistic, yet contains a dimension of pathos underneath the glistening guitars.

Since the song isn't on U.S. Spotify, I haven't heard it in years - until my memory was recently jogged by a question regarding Japanese-language music. Out of curiosity, I searched for the band's music videos on Youtube, and there they were! I'm happy to have a reason to remember a favorite song from my younger days.
