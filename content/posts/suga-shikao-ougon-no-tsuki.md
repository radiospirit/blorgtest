Possibly one of the funkiest J-Rock songs I've ever heard, with a chill casual vibe and easygoing pace.

Another song from my Hachikuro era back in college - I got into [Suga Shikao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shikao_Suga)'s back catalog in a big way after hearing some of his songs in the show. His raspy delivery complements the laidback nature of the song nicely, calm and relaxed, evoking the moments right after golden hour, when the air starts to cool down and the skies begin fading into the evening.
