			<description>I first heard Spitz&amp;lsquo;s music via the anime Honey and Clover (Hachimitsu to Kurōbā) back in college. This particular song of theirs wasn&amp;rsquo;t featured in the show, but is indicative of the kind of upbeat, sunny, jangly rock typical of their discography. From the opening guitar line to the wistful lyrics, &amp;ldquo;Robinson&amp;rdquo; conveys a summery kind of mood. There&amp;rsquo;s nuance in the juxtaposition between the upbeat pace of the song and the gentle melancholy of the melody.</description>

<p>I first heard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spitz_(band)">Spitz</a>&lsquo;s music via the anime <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honey_and_Clover">Honey and Clover (<em>Hachimitsu to Kurōbā</em>)</a> back in college. This particular song of theirs wasn&rsquo;t featured in the show, but is indicative of the kind of upbeat, sunny, jangly rock typical of their discography. From the opening guitar line to the wistful lyrics, &ldquo;Robinson&rdquo; conveys a summery kind of mood. There&rsquo;s nuance in the juxtaposition between the upbeat pace of the song and the gentle melancholy of the melody. The tune is deceptively optimistic, yet contains a dimension of pathos underneath the glistening guitars.</p>
<p>Since the song isn&rsquo;t on U.S. Spotify, I haven&rsquo;t heard it in years - until my memory was recently jogged by a question regarding Japanese-language music. Out of curiosity, I searched for the band&rsquo;s music videos on Youtube, and there they were! I&rsquo;m happy to have a reason to remember a favorite song from my younger days.</p>
